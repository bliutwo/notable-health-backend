# Notable Health Backend Application

This repo will contain whatever Notable Health asks me to implement.

> For the take-home, we ask you to implement a transcription text parser that transforms text based on certain phrases. It’s based on an actual problem we solved here and is meant to be representative of the kind of work we’d do together day to day week to week.You’re free to use whatever languages, frameworks, etc that you’d like. It’s a good idea to have a hello-world type project set up before you start the problem so you don’t spend time getting things set up.
